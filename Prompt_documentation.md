```2nd Prompt```

Modify the existing pet care website with the following exact changes while keeping all other sections exactly as they are:

1. **City Names**
   - Replace all foreign country or city names with only Indian cities and states (examples: Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Jaipur, Kolkata, Pune, Kochi, etc.).
   - Ensure every location in the adoption/selling section and blog references is Indian.

2. **Dog Breed Section**
   - Expand the breed list to include at least 12 popular dog breeds in India (examples: Labrador Retriever, German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, Beagle, Pug, Rottweiler, Boxer, Dachshund, Shih Tzu, Doberman, Indian Spitz, Great Dane).
   - Replace all AI-generated breed images with **high-quality real-world dog images** for each breed.
   - Each breed card should still have food, grooming, exercise, and hospitality details.

3. **Blog Section**
   - When clicking on any blog preview, it should open a **full blog page** with:
     - Full title
     - Cover image (real dog photo)
     - Complete blog content (AI-generated but realistic)
     - Back button to return to the blog list.

4. **Pet Care Details**
   - In the Pet Breed Care Guide section, if the user clicks **"View Details"**, it should open a **dedicated page** with complete information about that breed:
     - Large real dog images
     - Full details on food, grooming, hospitality, and exercise needs
     - Navigation back to the breed list.

5. **Keep Everything Else Exactly the Same**
   - Do not change the home page design, Dog-to-Human Age Calculator, animations, adoption/selling functionality, or any existing styling.
   - Maintain the premium, friendly, colorful, real-world look with wonderful animations.

Ensure these changes are implemented exactly and the site remains fully functional, responsive, and visually stunning.


```3rd Prompt```

Please modify my existing PetPass website with the following four enhancements while keeping the current design style, fonts, animations, and color scheme intact:

1. Blog Section Upgrade:

Change the section title from “AI Blog Session” to “Blog Session”.

Remove AI-generated blogs entirely.

Add a blog submission form inside the website where pet owners can create their own blogs.

The form should include fields for Title, Image Upload, Short Description, and Full Blog Text.

Submitted blogs should be stored and displayed automatically on the blog page as blog cards.

Ensure each blog card is clickable, and when clicked, it opens a dedicated full blog page showing the blog’s title, full-size image, and text content.

Display at least 5 sample real-world dog blogs with real dog images (no AI-generated images).

2. Chatbot Feature:

Add an AI-powered chatbot icon in the bottom-right corner of the website.

The chatbot should open when clicked and allow users to chat.

It should answer a mix of:

Dog care questions (feeding, grooming, health, training)

General pet adoption questions

Fun dog facts

Make the chatbot friendly, helpful, and in line with the theme of the site.

3. Footer Upgrade:

Create a simple, clean footer.

Include:

Copyright text

Quick links to: Home, Blog, Adoption, Age Calculator, Contact

Social media icons for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter

Match the style and color palette of the site. Keep it professional yet friendly.

4. FAQ Section:

Add a “Frequently Asked Questions” section just above the footer (on the same page, not a separate page).

Include at least 5 common questions and answers about dogs and adoption.

Use an accordion style so answers are hidden by default and expand smoothly when clicked.

Only one answer should expand at a time.

Ensure it works well on desktop and mobile, blending naturally into the site’s layout and design.

Please make sure all these features are fully functional, responsive, and visually integrated into the existing website design, with real dog images where applicable.
